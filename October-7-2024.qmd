Read in the data and assign data types

```{r}
tomatoes <- read.csv(here("data", "tomato_data.csv"))
tomatoes$Treatment <- as.factor(tomatoes$Treatment)
levels(tomatoes$Treatment)
```

Fix Factor variable (== means exactly equal to)

```{r}
fix1 <- which(tomatoes$Treatment == "control")
tomatoes$Treatment[fix1] <- "Control"
```

```{r}
fix2 <- which(tomatoes$Treatment == "fertilizer")
tomatoes$Treatment[fix2] <- "Fertilizer"
levels(tomatoes$Treatment)
```

```{r}
tomatoes$Treatment <- factor(tomatoes$Treatment)
```

# Exercise 2

```{r}
test <- c(2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20)

# Exercise 3

```{r}
grades <- c(90,94,96,90,84,86)
# Min = 84
# max = 96
(90+94+96+90+84+86)/6 #mean = 90
# median = 90
summary(grades)
```

```{r}
quantile(grades, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
